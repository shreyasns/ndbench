* This is a simple script proxy to provide seeds to dynomite.
* This script simulates dynomite-manager/florida in a very simple way(only for seeds) on the port 8081.
* Using this script you can point to any dynomite cluster whithout having to stop NDBench.
* Basically you just need to change the tokens and point to your dynomite cluster.
*
*
* How to install dependencies:
* 
* $ sudo npm install express -g
*
* In order to run:
*
* $ node ndbench-proxy.js
*
